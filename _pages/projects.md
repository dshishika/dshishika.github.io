Autonomy in Adversarial Environment
=====
As the large-scale deployment of multiple autonomous agents becomes more practical, maintaining security against adversarial autonomous swarms becomes important in both civilian and military defense applications. Driven by this motivation, I studied pursuit-evasion games (PEGs), where I developed a decomposition method that reduces a complex problem into smaller tractable pieces.

Bio-inspired Swarm Control
=====
Biological swarms show how complex group-level behaviors can emerge from completely distributed local in-
teractions. I have studied the mechanism of such local interactions among swarming mosquitoes, and used
the insights I gained to design distributed algorithms for cooperative target pursuit.

Communication and Control for Cooperation
=====
Effective interactions between the components of a multi-agent system are essential in maximizing the overall performance. I studied effective communication strategies in terms of how to maintain connectivity and what information to communicate.
